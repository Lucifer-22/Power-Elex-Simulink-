# Power Electronics (MATLAB/Simulink)

This comprehensive course on Power Electronics is designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles and applications of power electronic circuits. The course covers both theoretical and practical aspects of the subject, with a focus on the use of MATLAB/Simulink software for circuit simulation and analysis.

The course begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of power electronics and its applications in modern electrical systems. It then covers different types of rectifiers, including uncontrolled and controlled rectifiers, and inverter circuits. The course also delves into the detailed analysis of DC-DC converter circuits, including the Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost converters.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills through a variety of hands-on simulations and exercises using MATLAB/Simulink. All the resources and study materials including the simulink models, assignments, quizzes, and exams are available on Github repository: https://github.com/Lucifer-22/Power-Elex-Simulink-.git for reference and further study.

Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong foundation in the principles and applications of Power Electronics, and will be well-prepared for further study or work in the field. This course would be beneficial for the students of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering.
